# pcti-art-exhibition
An iOS art show app using Estimote beacons. Available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcti-art-exhibition/id1099168450?mt=8).

## Online vs. Offline mode
The app was originally designed to download application data and update its cache while in use. However, due to the weak signal strength in the deployment site, the app was refactored to work offline. Some code for the online version is still in the project.
